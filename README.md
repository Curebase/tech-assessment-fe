# Sr. Engineer tech assessment
As a Sr. Engineer we want to see your skills with architecture, security, performance and clean code.
<br />

The following tech stack are required:
- TypeScript
- React

These ones will be considered a differential, but are not required:
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) or [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- Unit Tests

<br />

# Goal
Develop a responsive React application based on this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/IGiTFyYotEnc94XwfMuVCE/Tech-Assessment?node-id=0%3A1) file, consuming a GraphQL endpoint.

# Screens

## Participants
You should fetch all the `participants` from GraphQL and list them on this screen.
  
## Trials
You should fetch all the `trials` from GraphQL and list them on this screen.

## Enroll a participant
This is a form to enroll a new participant to a clinical trial, all fields are required.

After you fill all the fields and clicked to persist the participant to the `participants` collection (doing a mutation to the GraphQL), you should redirect the user to a success screen presenting a message that shows if the participant is eligible or not for the clinical trial.

An eligible participant should:
- HAS DIABETES
- DIDN'T HAVE COVID
- BMI > 18
- BMI < 30

> BMI Formula: **weight (lb) / [height (in)]2 x 703**
>
> Divide weight in pounds (lb) by height in inches (in) squared and multiplying by a conversion factor of 703

<br />

# GraphQL API

We have a basic API setup on `/api`.

You need to setup a fresh API that implements the necessary GraphQL resolvers to retrieve / create / update the necessary data.

Feel free to use the tools of our choice to build that GraphQL API.

FAQ:
- You can use any framework of your choice like Nest.js, vanilla express + Apollo Server etc.
- You can use any ORM like Prisma, Sequelize etc.
- You can use any DBMS like Postgres, SQLite, MongoDB etc.

<br />

# Notes
- You need to be logged in with your Figma account to have access to all specs of the file and be able to extract colors, fonts, sizes and etc...
- Ensure that you have Node >=14.0.0 to run this project
